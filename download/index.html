Download and Installation Guide
===============================

Photog! is distributed as a [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) module. If
you are already familiar with installing Perl modules, simply
[grab the source code](http://github.com/rtts/photog) and install it
in your preferred way. If you're less familiar with installing Perl
modules, here is a step-by-step guide:

Step 1 -- Get Perl
------------------

The first step is to make sure that Perl, the interpreter of the
[Perl programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), is
installed. You can check this by running `perl -v` on a command
line. Perl is installed by default on Mac OS and almost all Linux
distributions. Windows users will have to
[download and run an installer](http://www.perl.org/get.html#win32).

Step 2 -- Download Photog!
--------------------------

The latest version of Photog! is 0.21. Download it with one of the
links below.  After downloading, extract the files to a temporary
directory.

<a href="https://github.com/rtts/photog/zipball/stable" class="button">Photog! v0.21 zipfile</a>

Step 3 -- Get ImageMagick
-------------------------

[ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) is collection of command-line
utilities to manipulate images. Photog! uses it to generate thumbnails
and watermarks. It's easiest to install ImageMagick using your
operating system's package manager. On Debian-based operating systems,
open a shell prompt and execute the following command:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

On Mac OS using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), open a terminal window
and type the following command:

    brew install imagemagick

Step 4 -- Install Photog!
-------------------------

You are now ready for the final installation step: installing Photog!
Open up a terminal window and type:

<pre>
cd ~/Downloads/Photog-0.21
<span style="font-style:italic; opacity: 0.5"># or wherever you extracted the files</span>
sudo cpan "."
</pre>

The CPAN utility will now automatically install all the necessary Perl
modules from the
[Comprehensive Perl Archive Network](http://www.cpan.org/). Sit back,
relax, and watch some interesting output scroll by on your
terminal. The output shows how every module is thoroughly being tested
before it's being installed.  When you get your prompt back, Photog!
is successfully installed on your system.

Step 5 -- Creating your first website
------------------------------------

To generate a photography website using the default settings, simply
`cd` to your Pictures directory and execute `photog` with the
destination directory as its argument:

    > cd ~/Pictures
    > photog ~/My-Photog-Website

Your photography website should now be available in the destination
directory. Go have a look!

Great! What Now?
----------------

The next step is to learn how you can configure Photog! to do exactly
what you want. There are many configuration variables available. You
can also customize the templates and the commands used to generate the
images. You can even specify a seperate configuration for each
subdirectory of your pictures folder. To learn how, head on over to
the [Documentation](/doc/).
