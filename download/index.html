Download & Installation Summary
===============================

Installing Photog! is super easy thanks to
[Cpanminus](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus) and
[local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/local::lib). First, make
sure you have [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) installed, then
open up a terminal and issue the following commands:

    > cpanm https://github.com/rtts/photog/tarball/stable
    > cd Pictures
    > photog ~/My-Photography-Website

Congratulations! Your photography website should now be available at
the destination you specified. Look for a file named `index.html` in
that location and open it in your web browser. The destination has
been saved by Photog! inside the file `photog.ini`, so the next time
you run `photog` to update your website you don't have to supply any
arguments!

Photog! is packaged as a Perl module that is available in the "stable"
branch of
[Photog! on Github]((https://github.com/rtts/photog/tree/stable)). Instead
of using the `cpanm` command above, you could also just clone the
repository or
[download the tarball directly](https://github.com/rtts/photog/tarball/stable).

A More Detailed Installation Guide
==================================

The rest of this guide is intended for people who are unfamiliar with
either [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) or
[CPAN modules](http://www.cpan.org/). It provides some general advice
about setting up Perl and installing modules, and concludes with
installing the Photog! module.

Step 1 -- Get Perl
-----------------

The first step is to make sure that Perl, the interpreter of the
[Perl programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), is
installed. You can check this by running `perl -v` on a command
line. Perl is installed by default on MacOS and almost all Linux
distributions, but Windows users will have to
[download and run an installer](http://www.perl.org/get.html#win32).

Step 2 -- Get Cpanminus
----------------------

Perl is known for having some of the the best tools and libraries
around. One such tool is Cpanminus which has become
[the recommended way](http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html) to
install packaged Perl code. Once you have Cpanminus installed it is
trivial to install additional Perl modules, either from downloaded
archives or directly from [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/), the enormous
Perl software archive.  The `cpanm` command of Cpanminus is the Perl
equivalent of Python's&nbsp;[`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/),
Ruby's&nbsp;[`gem`](https://rubygems.org/),
Node's&nbsp;[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), and
PHP's&nbsp;[`pear`](http://pear.php.net/).

The easiest way to install Cpanminus is to use your operating system's
package manager. On Debian-based systems, run `apt-get
install cpanminus`. On Redhat/CentOS/Fedora the command is `yum
install perl-App-cpanminus`. Other Linux distibutions have similarly
named packages available.

On Windows and Mac OS you'll have to use the somewhat old-fashioned
[CPAN client](http://perldoc.perl.org/CPAN.html) to install the module
named **App::cpanminus**. Enter the following commands at a command
prompt:

    > perl -MCPAN -e shell
    cpan[1]> install App:cpanminus

Quit the shell with the `q` command.

Step 3 -- Install local::lib
---------------------------

By default, Cpanminus installs modules system-wide which requires
admin or root privileges. If you're OK with that, you can skip this
step. Otherwise, install and enable **local::lib** to allow
unprivileged installation of modules to a user's home directory.

First, run `cpanm local::lib` as the system administrator to install
it (although it's also possible to install **local::lib** itself as a
regular user, see
[the bootstrapping technique](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/local::lib#The_bootstrapping_technique)).
Second, you'll have to enable it by setting a few environment
variables. The commands to do this are automatically printed out when
you execute `perl -Mlocal::lib`. If you're a bash user, append the
output of this command to `.bashrc`. On Windows, paste the output into
a `.bat` file and put it in the startup folder.


Step 4 -- Install Photog!
------------------------

Your Perl environment is now completely setup, and you can install any
Perl package using the `cpanm` command. Use your newly acquired powers
to install Photog! by running the following command:

    > cpanm https://github.com/rtts/photog/tarball/stable

Photog! by default uses ImageMagick to process images. If you want,
you can later use the configuration file to supply another image
processor (such as [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) or
[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Batch/)). Installing
ImageMagick is easiest with a package manager, e.g. `apt-get install
imagemagick`. Otherwise, visit
[ImageMagick's download site](http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)
to download a suitable installer.


Step 5 -- Create a website
--------------------------

To generate a photography website using the default settings, simply
`cd` to your Pictures directory and execute `photog` with the
destination directory as its argument:

    > cd Pictures
    > photog ~/My-Photog-Website

You can also specify the default destination inside a configuration
file named `photog.ini`, so you only have to run `photog` to generate
your website:

    > cd Pictures
    > echo destination = ~/My-Photog-Website > photog.ini
    > photog

Your photography website should now be available in the destination
directory. Go have a look!

Great! What Now?
-------------

The next step is to learn how you can configure Photog! to do exactly
what you want. Besides **destination**, there are many more
configuration variables available. You can also customize the
templates and the commands used to generate the images. You can even
specify a seperate configuration for each subdirectory of your
pictures folder. To learn how, head on over to the
[Documentation](/doc/).
