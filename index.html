Installation
------------

Installing Photog! is super easy thanks to
[Cpanminus](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus) and
[local::lib](search.cpan.org/perldoc/local::lib). The following
command will automatically install the latest stable version:

    $ cpanm https://github.com/rtts/photog/tarball/stable

Finally, make sure you have [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/)
installed before you start generating websites.

Creating a website
------------------

To generate a photography website using the default settings, simply
`cd` to your Pictures directory and execute `photog` with the
destination directory as its argument:

    cd ~/Pictures
    photog ~/public_html

Your photography website should now be available in the destination
directory. Go have a look!

Documentation
-------------

The complete documentation is available as a manual page after
installation. Execute the command `man photog` to read it. Another
manual page, `man Photography::Website`, documents the Perl library
that is used by Photog! For your convenience, both manual pages are
also reprinted below.
