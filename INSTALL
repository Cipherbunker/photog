Installation instructions
=========================

There's more than one way to install this program. By far the easiest is to
make sure you have Dist::Zilla installed (`apt-get install
libdist-zilla-perl` or `cpan Dist::Zilla`) and then simply run:

    dzil install

Another way is to first use Dist::Zilla to generate a traditional Perl
module package, which can then be installed like any other Perl module. I
recommend cpanminus to install the dependencies (`apt-get install cpanminus`
or `cpan App::cpanminus`). Use the following commands to install:

    dzil build
    cd photography-website-0.001/
    cpanm --installdeps .
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

A third option is to use the `cpan` tool to install the module package:

    dzil build
    cd photography-website-0.001/
    cpan .

In all cases, make sure you are running the installation commands as root,
or have local::lib installed and properly configured. Here's how to install
local::lib on a Debian system:

    apt-get install liblocal-lib-perl
    perl -Mlocal::lib >> ~/.bashrc
    . ~/.bashrc

After installation, a command named `photog` should be present in your PATH.
To generate a photography website using default settings, simply type
`photog` and enjoy!
