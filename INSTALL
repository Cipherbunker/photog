Installation instructions
=========================

To install this program you need Dist::Zilla, which can be installed
by running the following command as root:

   cpan Dist::Zilla

After that, make sure you're in the directory where this INSTALL file
is, and run the following command as root:

    dzil install

In case you ran these commands as a regular user instead of root, the
`cpan` and `dzil` tools have tried to install the required modules
locally to the ~/perl5 directory.  Unfortunately, this will break
things since the Perl installation does not know by default where
these modules are. To fix this, run (as a regular user):

   perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib >> ~/.bashrc
   . ~/.bashrc
   cpan Dist::Zilla
   dzil install

After installation, a manpage is available with the following command:

    man Photography::Website

Also, the command named `photog` should be present in your PATH. To
generate a photography website using default settings, simply type
`photog` and enjoy!
