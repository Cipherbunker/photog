Installation instructions
=========================

The installation of Photog! has been tested on Debian GNU/Linux and
Mac OSX. It should work on Windows, but as it uses some Unix utilities
(ls and grep) it will probably need Cygwin to run successfully.

First, make sure you have ImageMagick (http://imagemagick.org/)
installed (e.g., apt-get install imagemagick or brew install
imagemagick).

Second, you need Dist::Zilla, which can be installed by running
the following command as root:

   cpan Dist::Zilla

After that, make sure you're in the directory where this INSTALL file
is, and run the following command as root:

    dzil install

After installation, a manpage is available with the following command:

    man photog

Also, the command named `photog` should be available. To generate a
photography website using default settings, simply type `photog` and
enjoy!
