Installation Guide
==================

Step 1 -- Get Perl
------------------

Photog! is written in the
[Perl programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) and
will run on any system that has the Perl interpreter installed.  Perl
is installed by default on OS X and Linux, but Windows
users will have to
[download and run an installer](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads). You
can check if Perl is installed by executing this command in a
terminal:

    perl -v

(On Windows, the terminal can be found at Accessories > Command
Prompt. On OS X, the application is called "Terminal". After
starting the terminal, you can execute commands by typing them and
pressing Enter.)

Step 2 -- Get ImageMagick
-------------------------

[ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) is collection of command-line
utilities to manipulate images. Photog! uses it to generate thumbnails
and watermarks. It's easiest to install ImageMagick using your
operating system's package manager, if you have one. On Debian-based
operating systems, open a shell prompt and execute the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

On RedHat-based systems, use the following command:

    sudo yum install ImageMagick

On OS X using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), use this command:

    brew install imagemagick

Mac users without Homebrew and Windows users should use the
[ImageMagick installer](http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows).

Step 3 -- Install Photog!
-------------------------

You are now ready for the final installation step: installing Photog!
The installation command is the same on Windows, OS X, Linux, and any
of the [100 platforms](http://www.cpan.org/ports/) that Perl
supports. In your terminal window, execute:

    cpan Photography::Website

This command automatically downloads and installs Photog! from the
[Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)](http://www.cpan.org/).  Sit
back, relax, and watch some interesting output scroll by on your
terminal. Depending on your system's configuration, the `cpan` utility
might ask you some questions.  You can safely press Enter to accept
the default answers.

When you get your prompt back, Photog! is successfully installed on
your system!

**NOTE FOR MAC AND LINUX USERS: If this was your first time installing
  a CPAN module, you'll need to close the terminal window and open it
  again, so the settings that have been appended to your `.bashrc`
  file can take effect.**

Creating your first website
===========================

Now Photog! has been installed, you're ready to create your first
photography website! Simply `cd` to your Pictures directory and
execute `photog`:

    cd Pictures
    photog

Since this is your first run, Photog! will ask you what the
destination directory should be. Press Enter to accept the default
location. Now Photog! will start generating your website. When it's
done, look for a file named `index.html` in the destination directory
and open it in your web browser. Enjoy!

Great! What Now?
----------------

The next step is to learn how you can configure Photog! to do exactly
what you want. There are many configuration variables available. You
can also customize the templates and the commands used to generate the
images. You can even specify a seperate configuration for each
subdirectory of your pictures folder. To learn how, head on over to
the [Documentation](/doc/).
