Installation Guide
==================

Photog! is written in the
[Perl programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) and
uses the image-processing software
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/). Both of these tools are
operating system independent, which means you can install Photog! on
either Linux, Mac OS, or Windows. Here is a step-by-step guide to
getting Photog! up and running:

Step 1 -- Get Perl
------------------

Perl is installed by default on Mac OS and almost all Linux
distributions. You can check if Perl is installed on your system by
running the following command in a terminal:

    perl -v

If Perl is installed, this will output a short notice about the
version and license information. If you get the error message "command
not found" then you'll have to download and install Perl from
[the website](http://www.perl.org/get.html).

Step 2 -- Get ImageMagick
-------------------------

[ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) is collection of command-line
utilities to manipulate images. Photog! uses it to generate thumbnails
and watermarks. It's easiest to install ImageMagick using your
operating system's package manager. On Debian-based operating systems,
open a shell prompt and execute the following command:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

On Mac OS using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), open a terminal window
and type the following command:

    brew install imagemagick

Windows users should use the
[ImageMagick installer](http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows).

Step 3 -- Install Photog!
-------------------------

You are now ready for the final installation step: installing Photog!
Open up a terminal window and type:

    sudo cpan Photography::Website

The CPAN utility will automatically download, test, and install
`Photography::Website`, the Perl module that contains the Photog!
website generator. Sit back, relax, and watch some interesting output
scroll by on your terminal. When you get your prompt back, Photog! is
successfully installed on your system.

Creating your first website
===========================

To generate a photography website using the default settings, simply
`cd` to your Pictures directory and execute `photog` with the
destination directory as its argument:

    > cd ~/Pictures
    > photog ~/My-Photog-Website

Your photography website should now be available in the destination
directory. Look for a file named `index.html` in that location and
open it in your web browser. Enjoy!

Great! What Now?
----------------

The next step is to learn how you can configure Photog! to do exactly
what you want. There are many configuration variables available. You
can also customize the templates and the commands used to generate the
images. You can even specify a seperate configuration for each
subdirectory of your pictures folder. To learn how, head on over to
the [Documentation](/doc/).
