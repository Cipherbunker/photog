Documentation
=============

This page contains the documentation about running and configuring Photog! If you're looking for help installing Photog!, please read [A More Detailed Installation Guide](/download/#a-more-detailed-installation-guide) on the download page.

Photog! Manual Page
-------------------

The documentation of Photog! is available after installation as a Unix-style manual page. Execute the command `man photog` or `perldoc photog` to read it. The manpage is also available right here:

<div class="terminal"><iframe src="/man1.html"></iframe></div>

Photography::Website Manual Page
--------------------------------

The installation of Photog! also installs **Photography::Website**, the library used by Photog! to generate webpages. It has it's own manpage, which is mainly intended for developers and not for end-users. It is reprinted below.
