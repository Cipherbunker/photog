Documentation
=============

This page contains the documentation about running and configuring
Photog! If you're looking for help installing Photog!, please read
the [Installation Guide](/install/).

Running Photog!
---------------

Photog! is a simple, cross-platform command-line application. To
generate a photography website, `cd` to your Pictures directory and
execute `photog`:

    cd Pictures
    photog

Your photography website should now be available in the destination
directory. Go have a look!

Configuring Photog!
-------------------

After your first run, you will see Photog! has placed a file named
`photog.ini` inside your Pictures directory. You can configure the behavior of Photog! by editing this file
with a text editor such as "Notepad" on Windows or "Text Edit" on Mac OS. Please refer to the manual pages below for a more detailed explanation and a reference of all configuration options.

Manual Pages
------------

The complete documentation of Photog! is available
as a collection of Unix-style manual pages. They can be viewed with
the `man` or `perldoc` commands. For instance, the command `perldoc
photog` will show the general Photog! documentation. The available
manpages are:

- <a href="/man1.html" target="terminal">`photog(1)`</a> -- An
  overview of the command-line interface and an introduction to
  configuration and customization.

- <a href="/man3a.html"
  target="terminal">`Photography::Website(3)`</a> -- Describes the
  interface and the inner workings of the Photography::Website Perl
  module.

- <a href="/man3b.html"
  target="terminal">`Photography::Website::Configure(3)`</a> -- A
  comprehensive list of all configuration options and their default
  values.

For your convenience, simply click one of the links above and the
manpage will be displayed in the virtual terminal below.
